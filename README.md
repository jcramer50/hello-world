# hello-world
*This is the initial trial repo*

I'm pretty much awesome. Some of the best things about me include the following:

- my unibrow
- when I'm running from my problems, I'm literally running
- I live in a house with 4 girls â€“ it's important to balance out my uber-manliness

My motto: *The path to mediocrity is not a one-time decision. It's a life-long, dedicated pursuit of one's own personal not-quite ideals.*
